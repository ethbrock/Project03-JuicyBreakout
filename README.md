A basic implementation of some more 'juicy' features for a standard brickbreaking game
## Implementation
-Bricks spawn in with random colors
-On hit, bricks will briefly flash white before simultaneously expanding, returning to their original color, and fading out.
-There is a background that rotates back and forth.
-On a brick hit, the background faintly 'flashes'.
-When the ball hits one of the walls, it spawns particles.
-On start, there is a white fade-in effect.
-On death, the screen flashes red.
-Sounds for death, brick hit, and paddle hit.
-Added music to main menu.
